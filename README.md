**Introduction**
<br>
The Mavuradonha Smart Admission System is a digital solution developed in VB.NET to simplify and streamline the student admission process at Mavuradonha High School. The system automates data entry, subject selection, and admission confirmation—reducing paperwork and enhancing efficiency.
**Key Features**

1. Student Registration - Students enter their personal details, including name, gender, former school, and subject combination. - A user-friendly interface ensures data accuracy with validation features.
2. O-Level Grades Entry - Students select their ‘O’ level grades for core subjects such as Mathematics, Biology, and Chemistry. - The system checks eligibility for A-Level combinations based on subject requirements.
3. Admission Confirmation - Once the student meets the entry criteria, the system displays an acceptance message. - School rules and regulations are outlined, and students must agree to them before proceeding.
